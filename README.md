# ðŸ§© Capstone Branch: Drift Detection Model Implementation

This branch contains the **technical foundation** of our NYU MSBA capstone project â€” focused on detecting and visualizing **concept drift** in decision systems using deep learning.  
It expands upon the overview in the [`main`](../../tree/main) branch with full code, experiments, and supporting artifacts.

## ðŸ§± Project Scope

**Objective:**  
To design and evaluate machine learning models that detect **concept drift** â€” subtle, time-dependent shifts in data that can degrade predictive model accuracy and decision quality.

**Context:**  
Our case study simulates a historical **Lending Club** scenario to demonstrate how drift-aware AI can act as an early warning system for financial risk.

| **3. Counterfactual Simulation** | Simulated alternative data states to test robustness |
| **4. Macroeconomic Overlay** | Integrated external signals (interest rates, credit trends) |
| **5. Visualization** | Drift timeline plots, anomaly heatmaps, and reconstruction error trends |

## ðŸ’¡ Key Technical Insights

- **Early drift detection** enables faster strategic course corrections before model performance declines.  
- **Autoencoder-based anomaly scoring** effectively captures non-linear data shifts.  
- **Integrating macroeconomic overlays** reduces false positives and contextualizes model signals.  

These findings reinforce the importance of combining AI interpretability with business context to maintain trust and resilience in deployed decision systems.
