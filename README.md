# 👋 Hi, I'm Abdul Koroma

Welcome to my GitHub. I'm a strategic data and analytics leader currently pursuing my MS in Business Analytics at NYU Stern, with a professional background in marketing analytics, customer success, and product strategy.

My work spans applied machine learning, AI validation, GTM performance strategy, and customer-centric decision science. I've built models and dashboards that drive revenue outcomes, power strategic planning, and scale operational insight across enterprise, public sector, and startup environments.

This space is a curated portfolio of projects that reflect how I think — and how I solve problems.

## 🔍 Core Themes Across My Work

- **GTM & Customer Strategy**: Optimizing CAC, LTV, and churn through data-driven experiments and GTM dashboards.
- **AI/ML Applications**: Modeling data drift, validation pipelines, and risk detection in high-sensitivity contexts.
- **Marketing & Channel Analytics**: Building Marketing Mix Models (MMM), multi-touch attribution, and revenue diagnostics.
- **Smart City & Public Sector Modeling**: Open data analysis using network theory, forecasting, and clustering.
