## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository represents a multi-phase applied analytics project combining:
- **AI / ML Research** — Deep learning (autoencoders) for unsupervised drift detection  
- **Strategic Application** — Translating technical drift insights into business foresight  
- **Cross-functional Collaboration** — Bridging data science, business strategy, and interpretability
