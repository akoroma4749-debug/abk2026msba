# NYU MSBA Capstone: Drift Detection & Strategic Insights

This repository contains the technical implementation of our capstone project for the NYU MS in Business Analytics program. The project explores how concept drift modeling and anomaly detection can be used to identify hidden risks and blind spots in real-world decision-making systems ‚Äî particularly in scenarios like Lending Club‚Äôs business trajectory.

## üîç Project Overview

- **Goal:** To build and evaluate machine learning models that detect drift and structural shifts in data and decision systems
- **Case Focus:** A historical Lending Club scenario, with forward-looking drift modeling techniques applied to simulate early warning signals
- **Value Proposition:** Shows how AI/ML can complement strategy by surfacing anomalies *before* key outcomes deteriorate

## üìä Modeling Techniques

- Deep autoencoders for unsupervised drift detection
- Counterfactual simulations to estimate scenario variance
- Macroeconomic overlays for external signal integration
- Time-based visualizations of drift behavior and impacts
