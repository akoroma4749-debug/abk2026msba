# 🧠 NYU MSBA Capstone: Drift Detection & Strategic Insights

> *Exploring how concept drift and anomaly detection can identify early risk signals in dynamic business systems — bridging data science, governance, and strategic decision-making.*

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Develop and evaluate machine learning models that detect drift and structural shifts in real-world decision systems.
- **Case Focus:** Historical **Lending Club** data, reframed through forward-looking drift modeling to simulate early warning signals of portfolio deterioration.
- **Value Proposition:** Demonstrates how **AI reliability and model interpretability** can inform proactive business strategy, reducing risk and improving decision transparency.

**Why It Matters:**  
In volatile environments — whether financial, operational, or customer-facing — drift modeling provides an early lens into when models or assumptions start to fail. This bridges **AI accountability** with **business foresight**, a key theme across emerging responsible-AI practices.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Autoencoder-based drift detection outperformed classical tests for multidimensional drift.  
- Integration of macroeconomic and counterfactual data enhanced interpretability.  
- The framework can extend beyond fintech — e.g., **customer success drift**, **operational reliability**, or **AI validation pipelines**.

## 🤝 Collaboration Principles

This project was developed using AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) for refinement and documentation — not fabrication — aligning with **Anthropic’s values of reliability, interpretability, and human-centered AI**.
