## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- Feature engineering (e.g., `log_annual_inc`, `int_rate_bucket`, `dti_score`) is handled in the modeling pipeline under `/code/feature_engineering.R`
- Missing value imputation and variable binning is documented in `/code/data_prep.R`
- Variable usage by model type is outlined in `/model/model_coverage.md` (WIP)
