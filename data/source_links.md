## ðŸ”¹ 1. Synthetic Drift Dataset (DNN Autoencoder Paper)

- **Source**: *"Drift Detection Based on Deep Neural Networks and Autoencoders"*
- **Authors**: Thomas Haselhorst, JÃ¶rg Frochte
- **Download Link**: [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/thomas-haselhorst/drift-detection-dnn-autoencoder)
- **Description**: Provides synthetic datasets tailored for drift experiments using deep learning architectures. This was used as a **benchmark dataset** for our early validation and modeling pipeline setup.
- **Usage in Project**: Used for replication of baseline model and comparative evaluation of drift sensitivity metrics.

## ðŸ”¹ 2. LendingClub Loan Data (Historical Drift Use Case)

- **Source**: [Kaggle LendingClub Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wordsforthewise/lending-club)
- **Host**: Kaggle
- **Description**: A rich dataset of consumer lending behavior, including loan application attributes, repayment statuses, and issue dates.
- **Usage in Project**: Used to simulate a **real-world model drift scenario**, where credit risk models become less accurate over time due to changing borrower profiles and macroeconomic conditions.

## ðŸ”¹ 3. FRED Economic Indicators (Macroeconomic Overlay)

- **Source**: [Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/)
- **Selected Series**:
  - **GDP Growth**: [GDP](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP)
  - **Unemployment Rate**: [UNRATE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE)
  - **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**: [CPIAUCSL](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL)
- **Usage in Project**: Overlayed as **external drift drivers** to test macro-level influence on prediction quality deterioration.

## ðŸ”¹ 4. UCI Credit Approval Dataset (Exploratory Use)

- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval)
- **Description**: Smaller dataset used for initial pipeline experimentation. Includes anonymized credit approval features.
- **Usage in Project**: Explored during early modeling drafts; not used in final evaluation.

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Smart City / Energy Datasets (Experimental)

- **Sources**:
  - NYC Open Data â€“ [Energy Benchmarking](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/NYC-Building-Energy-Benchmarking/2k7d-ruhb)
  - DOE Open Data â€“ [Building Energy Use](https://openei.org/datasets/dataset/building-energy-usage)
- **Usage in Project**: Potentially used for domain transfer learning / exploratory transfer tests.
- **Status**: Tagged as experimental â€” not used in final drift analysis.
